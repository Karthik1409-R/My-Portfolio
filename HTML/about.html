        <p class="p1">I am a passionate and driven web developer currently pursuing my second year of B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Cyber Security. My enthusiasm lies in building interactive, dynamic, and user-friendly web applications that combine functionality with a sleek user experience. With a solid foundation in programming languages like Java and Python, along with strong proficiency in web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I constantly seek opportunities to apply and refine my skills in real-world projects.</p><br>

      <p class="p2">
        I am highly motivated by the ever-evolving nature of technology and am always eager to learn and adapt to new tools and frameworks that can enhance my front-end and back-end development capabilities. My goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer, capable of managing the entire development lifecycle â€” from designing responsive interfaces to implementing secure server-side logic.
      </p><br>

      <p class="p3">
        In addition to my technical pursuits, I am committed to improving my problem-solving abilities, especially through coding challenges and collaborative projects. I believe in learning by doing, and I strive to gain as much hands-on experience as possible through internships, workshops, and self-initiated projects. With a curious mindset and a growth-driven attitude, I am excited about the journey ahead in the tech industry.
